SMyLang: by Sasha Hedges

SMyLang (Smiley Language) is based on smileys -> :) 

There are many different types of smileys that represent the syntax of the language:

;) -> is a comment 

:) -> is the opening of a function, if statement, while loop, and blocks

:] -> is an opening of an array initialization or call

:> -> is an opening to a lambda

This is a basic function:
(smiley is the define keyword)

	:) smiley functionName :) parameters (:
	:)
    	    smile h = 4 :|
    	    h + 3 :|
	(:
	(:


This is a basic function call:

	functionName :) 1 2 3 (:

This is variable definition:

	smile variableName = 3 :|

This is a reassignment:

	grin variableName = 4 :|


This is an if statement:
    (else is optional)

	:)
	if x = 3?
	    :) "true" :| (:
	else 
	    :) "false" :| (:
	(:

This is a while loop:

	:)
	while x > 3?
	    :) grin x = x - 1 :| (:
	(:


This is a lambda:

	:> x y <: :) x + y :| (: 
	
	
This is a lambda call:

	:> x y <: :) x + y :| (: :) 1 2 (:	

This is an object:

	:) smiley object :) value (:
	:)
		smile t = "hi" :|
		this :|
	(:
	(:


This is accessing an object's values:

	smile objectName = object :) 4 (: :|
	objectName.value ----> 4
	objectName.t     ----> "hi"
	
This is an array:

	smile array = :] 1 2 3 4 [: :|
	
	
This is accessing an array:

	array :] 0 [:
	
	
These are the basics of SMyLang. Enjoy!
